# Challenges
- Unless otherwise stated, use simple concrete data types in your implementations (lists). Stretch challenges will give you an opportunity to refactor with collections and more complex data types.

- Graphs will be defined in a text file with the first line being a list of vertices, followed by one vertex pair per line representing the edges.

```
1,2,3,4
(1,2)
(1,4)
(2,3)
(2,4)
```

## Challenge 1
- Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency list
- Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency matrix
- Implement code to read in a graph from a text file to create an instance of the Graph ADT and use it's methods.
- Test your code.


### Stretch Challenges 1
- Re-implement the Graph ADT with adjacency matrix using one of the [python collections](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#module-collections)

## Challenge 2
- Add properties to your Graph ADT


## Challenge 3
### Stretch Challenges 3

## Challenge 4 : Dijkstra's and Priority Queue

### Stretch Challenges 4 : Implement Priority Queue
- (From CS 2.1).  Implement BinaryMinHeap using a dynamic array and then implement Priory Queue using BinaryMinHeap.  See [binary heap starter code](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.1-Advanced-Trees-and-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/Code/binaryheap.py) and [priority queue starter code](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.1-Advanced-Trees-and-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/Code/priorityqueue.py) for outline.
