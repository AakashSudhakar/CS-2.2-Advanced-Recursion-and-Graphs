# Topological Sorting and Scheduling

## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14FHYZYrE0GiH93Wd-F38scIOW84Mm-V0OHpgveqdI9w/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why you should know this...
Scheduling problems arise often in computer science and elsewhere, including instruction scheduling, logic synthesis, determining the order of completion tasks to perform, data serialization, and more.  Topological sorting produces a linear ordering of the vertices that represents the solution.


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Model scheduling problems as topological sorting.
1. Apply topological sorting to scheduling problems.
1. Use Directed Acyclic Graphs to model and solve problems.
