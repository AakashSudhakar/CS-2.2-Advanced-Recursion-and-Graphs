# Graph Traversals

## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bfFSSSj4j9H5nefw1gJfwvViPXt1RzdiyQ6l6ET2wAA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why you should know this...
Graph traversals allow us to discover and visit all the vertices in a graph. Traversals are used both to find common graph properties and form the basis of many other algorithms.  We will revisit them throughout the class.


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Implement Iterative and Recursive version of Depth First Search (DFS).
1. Implement Iterative version of Breadth First Search (BFS).
1. Compare and Contrast DFS and BFS to determine when to use each traversal method based on algorithmic complexity,
