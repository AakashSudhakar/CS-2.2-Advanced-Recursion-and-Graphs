# Advanced Modeling with Graphs

## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hs1B_YIXfLcyh9ElZlTO_glNur-gkMJCmuH4BvSpUF0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why you should know this...
So far we've explored many problems that can be easily reduced to a graph representation.  Modeling a trip between cities as a path between vertices is a relatively obvious transformation.  Many other problems may not initially present themselves as graphs, but can be transformed into them and then solved.  We'll look at a few to help build your graph modeling intuition.
