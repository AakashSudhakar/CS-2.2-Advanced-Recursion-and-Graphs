## Why you should know this...




## Learning Objectives (5 min)
1. Apply algorithms to determine if a graph is Eulerian and find Eulerian paths.
1. Apply algorithms to determine if a graph is Hamiltonian and find Hamiltonian paths.
1. Model the Traveling Salesman Problem and explore algorithms for solving it.


## Review
Now that we've implemented a few algorithms, you should be starting to see a common themes.

BFS for Shortest path. Proof by induction.
