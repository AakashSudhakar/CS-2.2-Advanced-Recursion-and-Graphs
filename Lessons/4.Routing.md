# Paths and Routing

## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvH1YpsiDTl8T_fB6xYF_gkwF_M11DDCme8Agd0EACc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why you should know this...
One of the most common applications of graph theory is to find and optimize a route between two vertices.


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Implement common graph routing and path algorithms
1. Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm using a priority queue.
1. Compare and Contrast Dijkstra's algorithm to other shortest path algorithm.

## Review
A route can be a *walk*, *path*, or a *cycle*.  These can be directed or undirected and the edges (arcs) can be weighted.
