# CS 2.2 Advanced Recursion and Graphs

Course Description

This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include recursion, greedy algorithms, memoization and dynamic programming. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems such as airplane routing, social networking, and board games.


### Why you should know this:

Graphs can be used to model and solve a wide variety of problems, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete get your degree here at Make School!  Understanding graphs allows you to build models of these problems and use those models to find optimal or best case solutions.


## Prerequisites:  

- [CS 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.3-Core-Data-Structures)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

- Describe graphs and common graph algorithms.
- Model and solve a variety of real world problems using graphs and graph algorithms.
- Implement the graph abstract data type and common graph algorithms in code.
- Develop algorithmic thinking skills to expand on common graph algorithms and improve problem solving approaches.


## Schedule

**NOTE:** Due to the shorter summer sessions, for some class sessions you will see multiple topics covered. This is to ensure that we cover the same material that we normally would in non-summer terms.
